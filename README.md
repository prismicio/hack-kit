## Hack development kit for prismic.io

### Getting started

#### Install the kit for your project

The best way to install the library is with the composer package manager ([install it](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if you haven't yet)

Then run this from your project's root in order to add the dependency:

```bash
composer require prismic/hack-sdk
```

If asked for a version, type in 'dev-master' (unless you want another version):

```bash
Please provide a version constraint for the prismic/hack-sdk requirement: dev-master
```

Usage in your Hack code:

```php
<?hh

include_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Prismic\Api;

```
